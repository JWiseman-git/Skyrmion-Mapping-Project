# Skyrmion Mapping

## _Boilerplate code for mapping skyrmion structures onto magnetic crystal lattices._

Included is a copy of the code used to generate the models and a copy of the final report.
This model was completed for the research thesis element of my Physics masters at Durham University.

**Usage guide**

The code above is broken down into capabilities:

1. [something](https://github.com/JWiseman-git/Skyrmion-Mapping-Project/tree/main) Generate an image of a Skyrmion lattice in 2/3 dimensions.
2. Calculate the local field being generated at a point specified by the user.
