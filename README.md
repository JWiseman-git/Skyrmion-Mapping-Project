# Skyrmion Mapping

## _Boilerplate code for mapping skyrmion structures onto magnetic crystal lattices._

Included is a copy of the code used to generate the models and a copy of the final report.
This model was completed for the research thesis element of my Physics masters at Durham University.
This code represents one of the few solely Python based Skyrmion models published - Therefore making it wiidely accessible to undergraduates of Physics degrees familiar with the more commonly taught python language.


**Basic Description of what is happening**

Included within the report is an explanation of why we see helical spin structures within certain chiral crystal arrangements. Solutions to energy equations give us our extended spin topology. However, the purpose of this code is to demonstrate for different lattices what is occurig

The code above is broken down into capabilities:

1. [Generate Lattice Image](https://github.com/JWiseman-git/Skyrmion-Mapping-Project/blob/main/GenerateLattice.py) - Generate an image of a Skyrmion lattice in 2/3 dimensions.
2. [Calculate Local Field Strength](https://github.com/JWiseman-git/Skyrmion-Mapping-Project/blob/main/FieldCalculation.py) - Calculate the local field being generated at a point specified by the user.
